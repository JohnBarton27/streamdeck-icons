# streamdeck-icons
A collection of images I use on my Elgato Stream Decks. The icons are categorized into different sections based on use case. Adobe Illustrator files are available for each icon as well.

The 'Acier BAT (Text Solid)' font is used for typography. This font can be found with Adobe Fonts.
